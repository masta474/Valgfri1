# Copilot Instructions for AI Agents

## Project Overview
This project currently contains a single file: `index.html`. It appears to be the starting point for a web-based project, but as of now, the file is nearly empty and does not implement any functionality or structure.

## Key Files and Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file. Currently, it only contains the HTML doctype and root tags.
- No other source files, configuration files, or documentation are present.

## Development Workflows
- There are no build scripts, test suites, or development tools configured yet.
- No package managers or external dependencies are detected.

## Project Conventions
- No project-specific conventions or patterns are established at this stage.
- The project is in a very early or placeholder state.

## Guidance for AI Agents
- If expanding this project, follow standard HTML5 and web development best practices.
- When adding new files, use clear and conventional naming (e.g., `style.css`, `main.js`).
- If introducing frameworks or build tools, document the setup and usage in a `README.md` at the project root.
- Update this file as the project evolves to reflect new workflows, conventions, or architectural decisions.

## Example: Adding a Simple Web Page
If you are tasked with expanding the project, start by fleshing out `index.html` with a basic HTML structure, and consider adding supporting files as needed:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Valgri Oppgave 1</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to Valgri Oppgave 1</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

---
_Update this file as the project grows to help future AI agents and developers understand the evolving structure and conventions._
